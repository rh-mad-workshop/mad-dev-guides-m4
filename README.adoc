## Overview

|===
|Audience Experience Level |Beginner
|Average Time to Complete	 |60 minutes
|===

This workshop aims to showcase how to enhance applications with API management and event streaming technologies.

## Key Takeaways

* The introduction of a streaming platform (Apache Kafka) to generate a stream of user activity events from the application web UI. 
* The introduction of an API Management solution (Red Hat OpenShift API management) to expose, secure and manage the APIs to the application backend services. 
* API First approach to design, host schema, mock APIs to  allows parallel streams of development between API implementers and API consumers.

## Technology Stack

* Red Hat OpenShift API Management
* Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka
* Red Hat build of Quarkus
* OpenShift API Designer
* OpenShift API Service Registry
* OpenShift Connectors
* Microcks/Postman
* Quay

## Documentation

This workshop is based on link:https://antora.org/[Antora] and link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/courseware-template[Red Hat scholars template] to build HTML based tutorials.


### Lab Parameters

This lab supports both link:site.yml#L17[Antora variables] than query parameters. Query params makes the workshop content dynamic, like URLs specific for your cluster to copy and paste.

NOTE: In the table above, CRC and Playground links use them.

Here's the list of all query params used (they are all optional, but generated links won't work unless at least `CLUSTER_SUBDOMAIN` is set):

[%header,cols=2*] 
|===
|PARAM
|Description

|`USERID`
| The username of your OpenShift cluster

|`SUBDOMAIN`
|The subdomain for your OpenShift cluster in the form `apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain>`, e.g. `apps.openshift.mydomain.tld`
